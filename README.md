This application is made using flutter 1.22.5. It runs on both android and iOS (current versions are supported).

At the root you'll find a folder called "APK". Inside you'll find two APK files. One release build and one debug build.

To build this app you will need to have flutter installed on your computer (Version 1.22.5 should work).
